            <p>
                clicks are reducing on cross-sell banners in Net Banking. This inturn leading to
                fewer conversions, which generate revenue to the channel. Cross-sell revenues need
                to be improved in Net Banking. 
                
            </p>

            <b>
                Solution:
            </b>
            <p>
                I improved the UI and placeholders of the banners placing them at various places
                across net banking. For the first few weeks I analysed the performance of the different
                placeholders. Later I conducted some user tests and interviewed customers to improve the
                CTR. I was able to derive some hypotheses which were tested used several A/B tests.
                After this I arrived at few recommendations which were later improved in production to all customers.

            <p>
                Because of high dependency on data teams, the turnaround time for getting data
                needed for product decisions is around 3-5 days. To get instant access to data and
                accelerate decision making process, Pages and events are to be tagged in Net Banking.                  
            </p>

            <b>
                Solution:
            </b>
            <p>
                I created a list of all the events and pages that need to be tracked for phase 1 of the project.
                Later by coordinating between IT teams and consultants, I implemented tags in Net Banking to track
                user behavior. Initial dashboards were created by consultants to get us started. I attended
                several webinars and events conducted by Adobe to learn adobe Analytics. I was able to learn it 
                with two months and I started building the dashboards required for Net Banking product decisions.
                I built dashboards to track KPIs and other key metrics used by product teams.

            <p>
                There are several customers who login to Net Banking using the same device most of the time.
                Still they need to complete two factor authentication to do the transactions as it is mandated
                by RBI. Identify alternate modes of authentication which can ensure safety and convenience to
                customers.                  
            </p>

            <b>
                Solution:
            </b>
            <p>
                I created a webauthn based proof of concept, which enables users to login to Net Banking
                by using inbuilt biometrics and security keys. User can use any of the biometrics like
                faceID, Windows Hello, PIN and fingerprint which are available on the device. Users can also
                use security keys provided by different third party manufacturers. This reduces
                risk of phishing attacks as there are no passwords involved and security keys are only
                accessible by Net Banking website.

               I created a prototype allows login to a new device using an existing device using
               QR code. This QR code is only valid for few seconds and changes in set frequency.
               This ensures that the fraudsters cannot login even if they send this QR to users 
               and make them scan as QR expires by the time users scan it in most of the cases.

            </b>
            <p>
                Users can login to their account on a new device using a existing device where user is already
                logged in. Users need to scan a QR code shown on old device using New device to activate.
                But fraudsters posing as bank employees started exploiting this feature by asking users to send
                the image of QR via mail or whatsapp. To protect users from vishing attacks identify a better
                authentication method.

            <p>
                By drawing inspiration from google pay and amazon pay apps, which using ultra low
                frequency sound to transmit transaction related data, I developed a prototype to
                use sound to authenticate. The prototype was developed using the APIs provided by
                google as a part of google play services. I later used SDKs provided by a developer
                named chirp which worked better tha google APIs. This prototype sends security key
                as a lowe frequency sound which can only be heard by another device. It is difficult
                to record and replicate sound unlike image in QR. This also ensures that the devices
                are in proximity and reduce the risk.

            </b>
            <p>
                users of the Net Banking were facing issue in receiving OTPs through SMS
                as some of them live in areas with weak or no connectivity. There several
                corporate customers who live in tch parks which have connectivity issues because of lower bandwidths.
                To reduce dependency on service providers for delivering SMS and reducing costs to the bank alternates
                were explored

                I created a prototypes which can provide Time based or count based OTPs to the customer.
                Any user with Google authenticator or similar authenticator apps can use this functionality. 
                By doing analysis of the pros and cons of the two types of open source offline OTPs, I concluded
                that Time based OTP is the better of two. Vendors are being explored to facilitate this solution
                as per guidelines given by RBI.
